# üîç Mastering Parentheses: A Guide to Validating Strings üìù

**Introduction:**
Welcome to our üåü awesome blog where we'll unravel the mystery behind one of the fundamental problems in programming - validating parentheses in a string. Brace yourselves as we journey through this fascinating problem and emerge victorious with our solution! üí™

**The Problem:**
Let's dive into the heart of the matter! We are given a string `s` containing only the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[', and ']'. üéØ The task at hand is to determine if the input string is valid. But what makes a string valid, you ask? Well, let's break it down:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every closing bracket must have a corresponding open bracket of the same type. üîÑ

**Example Cases:**
Let's illuminate this problem with some examples to help you grasp it better:

1. Input: s = "()" Output: true ‚úÖ
2. Input: s = "()[]{}" Output: true ‚úÖ
3. Input: s = "(]" Output: false ‚ùå

**The Solution:**
Ah, the moment you've been waiting for! Fear not, for we shall conquer this challenge with elegance and efficiency. Our weapon of choice? The mighty stack data structure! üõ°Ô∏è Here's the battle plan:

- Iterate through the string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack.
- When encountering a closing bracket, check if it matches the top element of the stack.
- If it does, pop the corresponding opening bracket from the stack.
- If not, or if the stack is empty, the string is invalid.
- Finally, if the stack is empty after processing all characters, the string is valid. üéâ

**Implementation:**

```python
def isValid(s: str) -> bool:
    # Mapping closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets
    Map = {")": "(", "]": "[", "}": "{"}
    stack = []

    for char in s:
        if char not in Map:  # If it's an opening bracket
            stack.append(char)
            continue

        if (not stack) or (stack[-1] != Map[char]):  # If it's a closing bracket
            return False

        stack.pop()  # Matching opening bracket found, pop from stack

    return not stack  # Return True if stack is empty, False otherwise
```

**Time and Space Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - where n is the length of the input string. We traverse the string once, performing constant-time operations for each character.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) - In the worst case, the stack could contain all opening brackets from the input string, resulting in linear space usage. üìè

**Some Notable Applications of Parentheses Validation:**

1. **Compiler Design and Parsing:** Crucial for ensuring syntactic correctness in compilers, aiding in efficient parsing of programming language constructs.

2. **Text Editors and IDEs:** Enables real-time error detection and code readability enhancement in text editors and IDEs.

3. **Mathematical Expressions Evaluation:** Essential for accurate evaluation of mathematical expressions, supporting algorithms like Shunting Yard or recursive descent parsers.

These areas demonstrate the wide-ranging significance of parentheses validation in computer science and software engineering.

**Conclusion:**
Congratulations! You've mastered the art of validating parentheses in strings like a true programming ninja! ü•∑ Armed with this knowledge, you're ready to tackle even more challenging problems in the vast realm of computer science and programming.
