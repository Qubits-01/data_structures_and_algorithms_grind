# üöÄ Unleashing Efficiency with Hashmaps: Solving the Two Sum Problem üöÄ

Welcome back to my data structures and algorithms grind! Today, I'm diving deep into the classic Two Sum problem, a fundamental challenge that sets the stage for mastering more complex algorithms. Let's embark on this journey of efficiency and problem-solving mastery!

**üéØ Problem Description:**

The Two Sum problem tasks us with finding two numbers in an array `nums` that add up to a given target. Our goal is to return the indices of these two numbers.

**Example:**

```markdown
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, so we return [0, 1].
```

**‚öôÔ∏è Constraints:**

- Length of `nums`: 2 to 10^4
- Elements of `nums`: -10^9 to 10^9
- Target value: Within the same range
- Exactly one valid solution exists

**üí° Solution Approach:**

I'm employing a hashmap to efficiently solve this problem. Here's my strategy:

```python
def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    prevMap = {}  # val -> index

    for i, n in enumerate(nums):
        diff = target - n
        if diff in prevMap:
            return [prevMap[diff], i]

        prevMap[n] = i
```

**üí¨ Code Discussion:**

- **Method Definition:** I define a method named `twoSum` which takes in `nums`, a list of integers; `target`, the target sum; and returns the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.

- **Hashmap Initialization:** Initializing an empty dictionary named `prevMap`. In Python, dictionaries (hashmaps) offer constant time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup on average.

- **Iterating through `nums`:** Looping through `nums` using the `enumerate` function to access both index `i` and value `n`.

- **Calculating the Difference:** For each `n` in the array, I calculate the difference `diff` between the target and `n`.

- **Checking Complement Existence:** I check if `diff` exists in `prevMap`. If it does, it means I've found the complement of `n` that adds up to the target. So, I return the indices of `n` and its complement from `prevMap`.

- **Storing in Hashmap:** If the complement doesn't exist, I store `n` along with its index `i` in `prevMap`.

**‚è∞ Time Complexity Analysis and Relevance of Hashmap:**

Utilizing a hashmap is crucial for achieving an efficient solution. Here's why:

- **Constant Time Lookup:** Dictionaries in Python offer constant time complexity (O(1)) for insertion, deletion, and lookup on average. This enables us to check if a complement exists for a given number in constant time.

By leveraging the constant time complexity of dictionary lookups, we achieve a linear time complexity of O(n) for solving the Two Sum problem, making our solution highly efficient, especially for large input sizes.

**üîç Conclusion:**

The Two Sum problem underscores the importance of selecting the right data structure for solving algorithmic problems efficiently. Hashmaps, with their constant time lookup, play a pivotal role in optimizing our solution to achieve linear time complexity. As we continue our journey in data structures and algorithms, mastering and effectively utilizing hashmaps will be invaluable.

**üíº Possible Applications of Hashmaps:**

Hashmaps find diverse applications across various domains:

- **Database Indexing:** Efficient indexing and retrieval of data in databases.
- **Caching:** Storing frequently accessed data for quick retrieval.
- **Symbol Tables:** Facilitating quick lookup of identifiers in programming languages.
- **Network Routing:** Storing routing information for efficient packet forwarding.

Understanding hashmaps and their applications equips us with powerful tools for efficiently solving real-world problems.
