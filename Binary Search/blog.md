# Title: Mastering Binary Search in Python 🚀

**Introduction:**
Welcome back to another exciting blog post! Today, we're diving into the fascinating world of algorithms, particularly focusing on a classic and efficient search algorithm known as Binary Search. We'll discuss what binary search is, how it works, and why it's so powerful. Moreover, we'll walk through a Python implementation of binary search for a sorted array, solving a common problem along the way.

## Binary Search: What's the Buzz About? 🎯

Binary search is a fundamental algorithm used to efficiently locate a target value within a sorted array. It's called "binary" because it continually divides the search range in half until the target value is found or determined to be absent. This results in a logarithmic runtime complexity, denoted as O(log n), making it incredibly fast for large datasets.

**Time Complexity:** O(log n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

### The Problem at Hand: Searching in a Sorted Array 🔍

Consider a scenario where we have an array of integers sorted in ascending order, and we need to find a particular target value within it. If the target exists in the array, we want to return its index; otherwise, we return -1. This problem aligns perfectly with the capabilities of binary search.

### The Solution: Python Implementation 🐍

Let's dive into the Python implementation of the binary search algorithm to solve the aforementioned problem. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

```python
def search(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while l <= r:
        m = l + ((r - l) // 2)  # Calculate the middle index to avoid overflow
        if nums[m] > target:
            r = m - 1  # Adjust the search range to the left half
        elif nums[m] < target:
            l = m + 1  # Adjust the search range to the right half
        else:
            return m  # Target found, return its index

    return -1  # Target not found
```

### Explanation of the Solution with Complexity Analysis

- We initialize two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), which represent the current search range within the array.
- In each iteration of the while loop, we calculate the middle index `m` of the current search range. We ensure to avoid overflow by using the formula `(l + (r - l) // 2)`.
- We compare the value at index `m` with the target value:
  - If `nums[m]` is greater than the target, we adjust the search range to the left half by updating `r` to `m - 1`.
  - If `nums[m]` is less than the target, we adjust the search range to the right half by updating `l` to `m + 1`.
  - If `nums[m]` equals the target, we've found our answer and return the index `m`.
- If the target is not found after exhausting all possibilities, we return -1.

**Complexity Analysis:**

Let n be the size of the input array nums.

- **Time complexity:** O(log n)
  - nums is divided into half each time. In the worst-case scenario, we need to cut nums until the range has no element, it takes logarithmic time to reach this break condition.

- **Space complexity:** O(1)
  - During the loop, we only need to record three indexes, left, right, and mid, they take constant space.

### Applications of Binary Search 🌐

- **Searching:** As demonstrated in our problem, binary search efficiently locates an element in a sorted array.
- **Finding Peaks:** In a mountain-like array, binary search can find the peak element efficiently.
- **Efficient Range Queries:** Binary search can be used to perform efficient range queries, such as finding the first or last occurrence of a particular element in a sorted list.

**Conclusion:**
Binary search is a powerful algorithm for searching within sorted arrays, offering logarithmic runtime complexity.
